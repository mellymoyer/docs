## Browsers

Fingerprint supports all popular browsers. We aim to cover at least 99% of all users according to our Fingerprint Identification statistics. The overall identification accuracy of traffic coming from supported browsers is industry-leading based on all Fingerprint identification statistics. Our research and development team continuously monitors releases of supported browsers and adjusts our identification algorithm if necessary.

At the moment, the supported browsers are:

| Browser          | Version | Notes                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Edge             | 105+    |                                                                        |
| Chrome           | 73+     |                                                                        |
| Firefox          | 89+     |                                                                        |
| Desktop Safari   | 13.0+   | See [below](#safari-intelligent-tracking-prevention) for more details. |
| Mobile Safari    | 13.0+   |                                                                        |
| Samsung Internet | 14.0+   |                                                                        |
| Brave            | all     | See [below](#brave-browser-support) for more details.                  |

Browsers not listed here may work, but we don't make guarantees about identification functionality or accuracy.

The identification accuracy of individual browsers may vary, and their impact on your overall identification accuracy depends on their prevalence in your traffic. See [Understanding our accuracy](/docs/understanding-our-995-accuracy) for an explanation of how we measure our accuracy.

### Safari Intelligent Tracking Prevention

Apple Safari has an on-by-default privacy protection feature called [Intelligent Tracking Protection](https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/), or ITP. ITP has been very effective in preventing cross-site tracking by completely disabling 3rd-party cookies and capping the lifetime of all script-writable website data.

By default, the Fingerprint API uses 3rd party cookies (both client-side set with `document.cookie` and server-side set with the `Set-Cookie` HTTP header) and script-writable website data (localStorage) to more reliably [identify returning visitors](https://fingerprint.com/blog/browser-fingerprinting-techniques/). All of these methods are affected by ITP, lowering identification accuracy. View the methods for [keeping identification accuracy high](#keeping-identification-accuracy-high) to maximize identification accuracy.

### Brave browser support

[Brave](https://brave.com/) is a privacy-focused browser based on Chromium. For our purposes, it behaves similarly to Chrome with a strict ad-blocking extension installed. That means it blocks the agent download and identification requests to Fingerprint CDN and API. View the methods for [keeping identification accuracy high](#keeping-identification-accuracy-high) to ensure your requests are not blocked.

### Keeping identification accuracy high

Ad-blocking extensions and browser features can disrupt visitor identification. To maintain high identification accuracy even with Safari and Brave, you need to use a [custom subdomain setup](/docs/custom-subdomain-setup) or a cloud proxy integration like [Cloudflare](/docs/cloudflare-integration) or [Cloudfront](/docs/cloudfront-proxy-integration-v2). These methods allow you to route Fingerprint HTTP requests through your domain, preventing browsers from blocking them and making cookies set by Fingerprint considered "first-party." See [Protecting the JavaScript agent from ad-blockers](/docs/protecting-the-javascript-agent-from-adblockers) for more details.

## Mobile devices

Fingerprint supports most iOS and Android devices in circulation today. The overall identification accuracy of traffic coming from mobile devices is even higher than that of browsers, thanks to long-lasting system-level attributes available on mobile platforms.

At the moment, the supported OS versions are:

| OS      | Version                               | Notes                                                                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Android | 5.0 Lollipop (API Level 21) or higher | See [Android](/docs/native-android-integration#supported-versions) for more details. |
| iOS     | 13+                                   | See [iOS](/docs/ios#supported-versions) for more details.                            |
