title: "Smart Signals Introduction"
description: Smart signals give you actionable device intelligence for browsers and devices interacting with your application.
---

In addition to visitor identification, Fingerprint provides actionable device intelligence insights called Smart Signals. They provide details on suspicious browser or device configurations, which can indicate malicious intent. For example, you can detect bots, VPN usage, tampered browsers, or jailbroken iPhones and adjust your business logic accordingly. Read our [blog post](https://fingerprint.com/blog/power-of-smart-signals-fraud-detection-prevention/) to learn how to get the most out of Smart Signals.

## Availability

The availability of each Smart Signal depends on the platform (Browser, Android, or iOS) and your [billing plan](https://fingerprint.com/pricing/).

* Most Smart Signals are available in the Pro Plus plan. These three signals are currently only available for Enterprise customers: [IP Blocklist](smart-signals-reference#ip-blocklist-matching), [High-Activity Device](smart-signals-reference#high-activity-device), and [Raw Device Attributes](smart-signals-reference#raw-device-attributes).
* Enterprise plans are customized for each customer. If you are an Enterprise customer interested in one or more of these signals, please contact our [support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/) to enable them for you. Signing up for an Enterprise plan does not automatically enable all Smart signals.

See [Pricing](https://fingerprint.com/pricing/) or [Smart Signals Reference](/docs/smart-signals-reference) for more details.

## Setup and Usage

Smart Signals are computed using the same device attributes collected for visitor identification. If you haven't already, [install the JavaScript agent on your website](/docs/install-the-javascript-agent), or add the [Android](/docs/native-android-integration), or [iOS](/docs/ios) agent to your mobile application to make identification requests.

Unlike the visitor ID, Smart Signals are *not available* in the identification response sent back to the client agents. Because Smart Signals are focused on fraud detection, we only make them available through our [Server API](/reference/getevent), [Webhooks](webhooks), and [Sealed Client Results](/docs/sealed-client-results) so we can ensure you receive those results unaltered.

For example, you can:

1. Get the [`requestId`](/reference/get-function#requestid) from the JavaScript agent identification response and pass it to your server.
2. Call the [GET /events](/reference/getevent) endpoint from your server-side environment and retrieve the Smart Signals in the API response.
3. Use the Smart Signals information in your fraud prevention logic.

Some signals apply to all platforms and some are specific to browsers, Android, or iOS devices. You can see a brief overview of all available signals in the tables below. For detailed information about each signal, see the [Smart Signals Reference](/docs/smart-signals-reference).

## Suspect Score

Suspect Score is a quick and easy way to integrate Smart Signals into your fraud protection workflow. It is a weighted average of all Smart Signals indicating how unusual or suspicious the device is in a single number.

The more Smart signals return a positive result, the higher the Suspect Score. You can customize how much each Smart signal contributes to the final Suspect Score. See [Suspect Score](/docs/suspect-score) for more details.
