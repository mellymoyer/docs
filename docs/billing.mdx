## Fingerprint Platform Billing

Customers are billed monthly based on the number of identification API requests made over the billing period. The Fingerprint Platform has two plans: [Pro Plus and Enterprise](https://fingerprint.com/pricing/?utm_source=https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/quick-start-guide).

<Info>
Check out our [Pricing](https://fingerprint.com/pricing/) to learn which plan is best for your needs.

</Info>

Custom pricing options are available for businesses that require 6,000,000 annual API requests or more. Please reach out to our [Sales team](https://fingerprint.com/contact-sales/).

### Identification API request as a billing unit

A billable API request happens when you *successfully* use the Fingerprint client agent to identify a browser or mobile device. Identification requests successfully processed by Fingerprint generate a `requestId` that is returned in the response.

* All identification requests with an assigned request ID are billable.
* Requests that do not generate a request ID are not billed.

The following requests are **billable**:

* Calling the [`get()`](/reference/get-function) function of the Fingerprint JavaScript agent.
* Calling the [`getVisitorId()`](/docs/ios-sdk#getting-a-visitorid) function of the iOS SDK.
* Calling the [`getVisitorId()`](/docs/android-sdk#getting-a-visitorid) function of the Android SDK.
* Calling equivalent functions in our [Flutter](/docs/flutter), [React Native](/docs/fingerprintjs-pro-react-native), or [frontend libraries](/docs/frontend-libraries).

The following requests are **not billable**:

* Downloading the client agent (calling the [`load()`](/reference/load-function) function) is not billable.
* Requests to [Server API](/reference/pro-server-api) are not billable.
* Requests blocked by ad blockers or application firewalls are generally not billed.
* Failed requests that result in an error without generating a request ID are not billed.
* Throttled identification requests are not billed.
* Requests filtered by [Request Filtering](/docs/request-filtering) are not billed.

If you encounter any billing issues or believe the billing is not working correctly, please reach out to [our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/) to resolve your issue.

#### How many API calls will I need?

If you're unsure how many API calls you'll need, try these two options:

1. Start with an [unlimited 14-day free trial](https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/signup) to test all Fingerprint products. By the end, you'll know how many API calls you need.
2. If a trial isnâ€™t possible, estimate the number of important actions where you'll use Fingerprint, like logins, account creation, payments, refunds, or return requests.

### Android API Call Allowance

Pro Plus customers receive 500,000 free Android API calls per month. These API calls apply when using our [Android SDK](/docs/android-sdk), [React Native](/docs/fingerprintjs-pro-react-native), or [Flutter](/docs/flutter) SDKs within an Android app. See [more details](/docs/android-api-call-allowance) on the allowance.

### Caching

When your application code retrieves visitor data from the application cache, it is not billed. Only requests that hit the Fingerprint backend are billed. Our [frontend libraries](https://fingerprint.com/sdk-libraries/) for specific web frameworks provide various caching strategies.

The number of billed requests will depend on your selected caching strategy. See [Caching visitor information](/docs/caching-visitor-information) for more details.

### Smart signals

[Smart signals](/docs/smart-signals-overview) (for example, Bot Detection, VPN Detection, and more) are available to users on the Pro Plus or Enterprise plans.

### Billing changes

We reserve the right to change the billing model for our current or future products. In the event of an upcoming billing change, we'll send a notification to all our customers with a notification at least 30 days before the billing change event.

### Other Fingerprint platform features

Other Fingerprint platform features, such as [Server API requests](/reference/pro-server-api), [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks), [Custom subdomains](/docs/custom-subdomain-setup), [Request filtering](/docs/request-filtering), [Proxy integrations](/docs/protecting-the-javascript-agent-from-adblockers#cloud-proxy-integrations), [libraries, and SDKs](https://fingerprint.com/sdk-libraries/) are free of charge with certain limitations per account. See below for more details.

## Account limits

All Fingerprint **accounts** are limited to **one unlimited 14-day free trial**. After you sign up, you are automatically enrolled in the free trial and can try the Fingerprint API without limitations. After the trial period ends, you must upgrade to a paid plan to continue using Fingerprint.

All Fingerprint **workspaces** have the following default limits:

### Increasing Limits

If you are a customer and want to increase a limit, please reach out to [our support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/).

</Info>

### Rate Limiting - Burst Protection

Short unexpected traffic spikes could normally cause request throttling if the API key exceeded the API Rate Limit. **Burst protection** prevents that by allowing peak traffic to be higher than usual for a short period of time. The allowed burst size (bucket) is always `API Rate Limit * 3` (15 RPS in the default configuration). The burst bucket automatically regenerates every second by `API Rate Limit - RPS` when the current RPS is lower than the `API Rate Limit`.

#### Examples

Real world examples of burst bucket depletion with different RPS values (considering the default `API Rate Limit` value above):

* Burst bucket **never depletes** when RPS is 5
* Burst bucket depletes **in 15 seconds** on 6 RPS
* Burst bucket depletes **in 3 seconds** on 10 RPS
* Burst bucket depletes **in 1 second** on 20 RPS

Whenever the bucket depletes, the service starts dropping requests above `API Rate Limit`.

### How am I protected from overpaying?

Fingerprint offers two types of **surge protection** for all customer accounts. First is DDoS protection, so you won't be charged for API calls during an attack. Second is a web application firewall (WAF) that blocks harmful or abusive bot requests.

Each request also goes through a customizable [request filtering](/docs/request-filtering) layer. This lets you block requests from unknown sources, limit API calls to certain web apps, or ignore requests based on HTTP headers.

In the rare case a malicious surge gets through, we can waive the API call charges.
