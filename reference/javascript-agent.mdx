The Fingerprint JavaScript agent is a high-performance JavaScript function that collects multiple device and browser signals and sends them to the Fingerprint Platform API for visitor identification and device intelligence analysis.

This section contains the complete API Reference for the JavaScript agent, specifically:

* [The load() function](/reference/load-function) options that are used to download and initialize the JavaScript agent.
* [The get() function](/reference/get-function) options for sending identification requests and its response schema.
* [Error handling reference](/reference/error-handling).

## JavaScript agent guides

If you are just getting started with Fingerprint, we recommend reading the following guides first:

* [Install the JavaScript agent](/docs/install-the-javascript-agent)
* [Identify visitors](/docs/identify-visitors)

## Framework-specific SDKs

If your web application is built using **React**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, or **Angular**, we recommend using a higher-level library wrapping the JavaScript agent made for your specific framework. See [Using a framework-specific SDK for more details](/docs/install-the-javascript-agent#using-a-framework-specific-sdk).

## Changelog

To keep track of changes and updates to the JavaScript agent, see the [JavaScript Agent Changelog](/changelog).

## Browser support

The JavaScript agent supports all currently popular browsers. For more details, see [Browser and device support](/docs/browser-and-device-support).

## TypeScript support

If you install the JavaScript agent using the [NPM loader package](/docs/install-the-javascript-agent#installing-the-agent-loader-using-npm) or one of our [client libraries](/docs/install-the-javascript-agent#using-a-framework-specific-sdk), it includes TypeScript types.

The agent officially supports TypeScript version **5.1** but may work with newer and older versions of TypeScript. Please see [TypeScript errors](/reference/error-handling#typescript-errors) if you encounter any problems.

## Mobile device client agents

The JavaScript agent is used to identify and provide intelligence about **browsers**. For mobile identification and device intelligence, please see:

* [Identify Android devices](/docs/native-android-integration)
* [Identify iOS devices](/docs/ios)
