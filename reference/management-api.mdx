**Management API** allows you to manage your Fingerprint account and workspaces programmatically from a server environment.

Management API is only for server-side usage, it's not intended to be used from the client side, whether it's a browser or a mobile device.

<Tip>
  ### Management API requests do not count toward your monthly plan and are not billed.
</Tip>

## Getting started

We are making some changes around here.

Management API is available globally:

| Region | Base URL                         |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| Global | `https://management-api.fpjs.io` |

You can use Management API for all your workspaces, regardless of their region.

### Authentication

Management API requests are authorized by using the **Management API key** that can be obtained in your Fingerprint Dashboard by visiting [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/api-keys).

Set your API key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-management-api-key
```

Read more about [Authentication](/reference/management-api-authentication).

### Version

Management API is versioned by date of the backwards-incompatible change made to the API. The latest version is `2024-05-20`.

Set the version as in the `X-API-Version` header:

```
X-API-Version: 2024-05-20
```

Read more about [Versioning](/reference/management-api-versioning).

### Making a request

Now we're ready to make our first request\!

We can try to list all our environments by calling `GET https://management-api.fpjs.io/environments`. Note the added `Authorization` and `X-API-Version` headers.

<CodeGroup>

```powershell cURL
curl -XGET -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-management-api-key' -H 'X-API-Version: 2024-05-20' 'https://management-api.fpjs.io/environments'
```

</CodeGroup>

You should get a response listing all your workspace environments:

<CodeGroup>

```json JSON
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "env_ff035a1dd7655da15295fa5fa89362a7",
      "name": "Default environment",
      "created_at": "2023-10-05T14:48:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

And you're all set\! Feel free to explore other methods available in Management API.

### Rate limiting

Management API is rate limited. The limit is enforced for every **Management API key**, and the default rate limit per API key is **5 req/sec**.

If you are an [Enterprise plan](https://fingerprint.com/pricing/) customer and your use case requires a higher limit, please reach out to our [support team](https://fingerprint.com/support/).

### Client SDKs

SDKs for specific languages are coming soon\!

## Using API reference

You can try calling the Management API directly from this documentation:

1. Go to one listed API methods, for example [**List environments**](/reference/environmentcontroller_findall).
2. Set your API key as**Authorization** bearer token.
3. Set API version by setting **X-API-Version** header to `2024-05-20`.
4. Click **Try it\!**.

A real API response will appear in the **Response** section.
